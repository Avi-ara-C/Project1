    <h1>Aviara Caraveo</h1>
    <p>My name is Aviara Caraveo; I prefer my nickname Avi. I am 20 years old and I am currently working towards my major--Computer Science. I have always enjoyed using technology from a young age. When I was about 12 years old, I began learning video and picture editing (iMovie and photoshop). I loved it so much...it's a way I can mix my love of tehcnology with my love of art and creativity. I hope to expand my knowledge through this class and further my skills.</p>

    <h2>When I have free time...</h2>
    <ol>
    <li> I love to play video games on my Nintendo Switch. </li>
    <li> I enjoy learning new songs on my guitar. </li>
    <li> I like to go out with my friends.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> My favorite website is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> because it is relaxing to scroll through and find inspiration for artistic acitivites, room decoration, DIYs, fashion, and so much more.</p>
